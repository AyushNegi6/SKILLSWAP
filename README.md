# SkillSwap

**SkillSwap** is a web-based platform built with **Next.js** that helps people connect through **skill exchange**.

Instead of learning only from courses or videos, SkillSwap focuses on **person-to-person learning** — where one user can teach a skill they know, and in return learn a skill from someone else.

It is a simple idea, but powerful:  
**everyone knows something, and everyone wants to learn something.**  
SkillSwap is built around that exchange.

## What it is

SkillSwap is a **skill-for-skill learning platform**.

It allows users to create their own profile, list the skills they can offer, and mention the skills they want to learn. Other users can then explore profiles, discover matching people, and connect for a possible skill exchange.

For example:

- A user who knows **Graphic Design** can offer design help
- That same user may want to learn **Web Development**
- Another user who knows Web Development can connect with them
- Both users benefit by exchanging skills

So instead of money being the only way to learn, SkillSwap creates a system where **skills themselves become value**.

## Why it is made

The idea behind SkillSwap comes from a very common problem:

Many people want to learn new things, but:
- they do not always know where to start
- courses can feel one-sided
- learning alone can become boring
- not everyone can spend money on every skill they want to learn

At the same time, many people already have useful skills but do not get enough chances to share them.

SkillSwap is made to solve this by creating a space where:
- people can **learn directly from each other**
- people can **teach what they already know**
- learning becomes more **interactive and practical**
- collaboration becomes part of the learning process

The goal is to make learning feel more:
- **human**
- **accessible**
- **community-driven**
- **mutually beneficial**

It is not just a platform for finding skills — it is a platform for building connections through learning.

## What it does

SkillSwap provides the core features needed for a skill exchange platform:

### 1. User Profiles
Users can create a profile that represents who they are and what they want to learn or teach.

This helps others quickly understand:
- what skills they offer
- what skills they are looking for
- who they can connect with

### 2. Skill Listings
Users can add:
- **Skills they can teach**
- **Skills they want to learn**

This is the heart of the platform because it makes matching and discovery possible.

### 3. Explore Users
Users can browse and explore other profiles on the platform.

This makes it easy to:
- discover people with useful skills
- find possible learning partners
- check who might be a good skill swap match

### 4. Skill Swap Requests
Users can send skill swap requests to other users.

This helps start the exchange in a structured way, where users can:
- send a request
- accept or reject requests
- manage ongoing swap connections

### 5. Learning Through Exchange
The main purpose of SkillSwap is to encourage people to grow by helping each other.

It supports a model where:
- one person teaches
- one person learns
- and both can switch roles depending on the skill

This creates a more balanced and interactive learning environment.

## Overall Vision

SkillSwap is more than just a basic user listing platform.

It is built with the idea that **learning should be shared**, and that people can create value for each other without always depending on traditional systems.

In short, SkillSwap helps people:

- **teach what they know**
- **learn what they need**
- **connect with others**
- **grow together**
